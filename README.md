# MSSE-Capstone-Project â€” MCP Starter for Garmin + Weather

This repository is a starter Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for an MSSE capstone project. It provides a focused integration point for Garmin activity data and external weather information so users can better plan their workouts.

## Purpose

This project is intended as a minimal, well-documented starting point for building an MCP-compatible service that:

- Collects activity and health data from Garmin (via Python Wrapper API).
- Enriches activity data with weather and forecast information from a weather API.
- Provides an interface (MCP endpoints / context provider) so agents or tools can query user activity + environmental context to make workout recommendations.
